## When does it all become clear?

Never.

## `res.redirect`

What does it do?

Causes a response to get sent to the client, and the client will immediately send another request.

## What's with `next`?

Next will _not_ send a response, it simply tells the server express app "keep looking for a matching middleware down the pipeline".

Do we have to have it?

## Advantage of deep cloning?

## Can you keep nesting templates?

Yes.
