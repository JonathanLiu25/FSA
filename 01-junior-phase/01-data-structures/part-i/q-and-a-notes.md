## What is stateful?

What is state in programming?

The set of values at a given moment, it changes!

Reducing the number of moving parts is always a good idea, so reduce the number of variables that change in your program.

## Garbage collection, JS sanitation division

What is that?

Freeing up memory whose data is no longer neededâ€”automatically.

Javascript does this with objects that nothing is pointing to. The v8 does this automatically every so often.

## Node one argument

Sure.

## Amortized clearing

It's better to do something infrequently than always (if we can get away with it).

Trading time for space.


## Plus plus

```js
var x = 9;
var y = x++; // increments variable but returns previous value
console.log(y); // 9
console.log(x); // 10
```

...it's sort of like:

```js
function plusPlus (obj, property) {
  var old = obj[property];
  obj[property] = obj[property] + 1;
  return old;
}

var thing = {x: 4};
var oldValue = plusPlus(thing, 'x');
```
